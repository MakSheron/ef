Everything Functional
====================

It looks hard at the beginning, but functional programming is an
oppertunity to discover a new way to represent programs, to approach a
problem, and to think about
languages[1](http://acm.wustl.edu/functional/whyfp.php).

I began programming using imperative languages and used imperative languages last 8 years. But doing [B521](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/c311/doku.php) taught by [Dan Friedman](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dfried/) in the first semester of my PhD program, inspired me to learn more about functional programming and programming language implementations. I am planning to add every exercise I am doing to this repository for future reference.
