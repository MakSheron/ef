# Web App Written in Clojure Based on Ring and Compojure

This is a sample web app I developed based on [blog post](http://mmcgrana.github.com/2010/07/develop-deploy-clojure-web-applications.html) by
[Mark McGranaghan](http://mmcgrana.github.com/). That post was really helpful, but there were some incompatibilities with the latest versions
of the libraries used. I did some additional improvements to make it wrok as a WAR.
